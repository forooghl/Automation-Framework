# Network Automation Framework

## Overview

Welcome to the **Network Automation Framework**! This project aims to automate the management and configuration of network devices and Linux servers using powerful tools like **Ansible**, **Vagrant**, **GNS3**, and **VyOS**. 

With this framework, you can:
- Manage network devices (like VyOS routers) and Linux servers effortlessly.
- Automate routine tasks such as configuration, backups, and disaster recovery.
- Monitor system thresholds and trigger actions based on system status.
- Interact with the framework through an easy-to-use **Django-based web interface**.

## Features
- **Multi-device management**: Configure network devices and servers in a consistent and automated way.
- **Disaster recovery**: Back up configurations regularly and restore them when needed.
- **Threshold-based monitoring**: Set custom thresholds (e.g., CPU, disk usage) and trigger actions like alerts or automatic remediation.
- **Web UI**: A simple web interface built with Django for managing automation tasks, viewing logs, and configuring the system.

## Tools Used

This framework is built using the following tools:
- **Ansible**: A powerful automation tool for configuration management.
- **Vagrant**: For managing virtual machines and ensuring a consistent development environment.
- **GNS3**: Network simulator for creating virtual network topologies.
- **VyOS**: Open-source network OS for router functionality.
- **Django**: A web framework to manage and interact with the automation tasks.
